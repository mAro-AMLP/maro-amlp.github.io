Hi! I'm Kiran, a software developer with a passion for storytelling. I love creating worlds and characters and getting lost in the magic of writing. When I'm not coding away, you can usually find me with my nose in a book, trying to decipher the secrets of the universe (or just figuring out how to write a really good fight scene).

I'm also a big fan of learning new things.  Whether it's picking up a new programming language or attempting to juggle (with varying degrees of success), I'm always up for a challenge. And speaking of challenges, I enjoy a good game of badminton, though I'm probably more enthusiastic than skilled.

If you're interested in chatting about books, writing, or anything else that strikes your fancy, feel free to get in touch!
